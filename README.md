# CloudSim-Assignment-3
A CloudSim simulation (Java) that models a Data Center Host. It defines three VM types (Small, Medium, Large) to analyze CPU and RAM utilization metrics and verify efficient Resource Provisioning.

# Cloud Resource Modeling Simulation

This project simulates a cloud data center using the **CloudSim 3.0.3** framework.

**Objective:**
To model a physical Host and analyze how efficiently it handles different types of Virtual Machines (VMs).

**Key Features:**
- **Host Configuration:** 16GB RAM, 8 CPU Cores.
- **VM Configuration:** Defined Small (1 Core), Medium (2 Cores), and Large (4 Cores) instances.
- **Metrics:** Calculates and outputs the final VM-to-Host mapping and total Resource Utilization %.
